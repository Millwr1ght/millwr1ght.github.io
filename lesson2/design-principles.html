                        YouTube does a great job of using repetition in their mobile site design. You can tell where each 
                        video card begins and ends because each one is has the same elements: a title card, the video 
                        creator, and the video's title, duration and view count information. Not only does it help users 
                        recognize separate videos, but it makes for a cleaner site.

                        This is a sceencap of the Quad Cities travel website home page. Here you can see the bright, 
                        contrasting colors they used for their site design. The different blues and oranges used are
                        consistent throughout the site, and provide great contrast for the white text above them. 
                        Everything on this site is readable and clear.

                        This is the front page of krunker.io, a FPS browser game. Typically it would be played on a desktop
                        or laptop computer, but here we have it loaded up on a mobile device. All the game's options and
                        extras are left-aligned with each other along the edge of the screen. This use of alignment is 
                        better on the eyes and makes it easier for users to find what they're looking for.
